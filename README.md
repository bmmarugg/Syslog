# Syslog
This is a script that will connect to each IP address in the user-provided list and check certain conditions (hostname and platform of device) to decide which specific syntax is needed. This is a script designed for teams with multiple syslog servers spread out across their environment, where each site has it's own dedicated poller/collector.
